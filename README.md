Build a simple key-value storage engine in 3 week!

## Tutorial

The tutorial is available at [https://ben1009.github.io/mini-lsm](https://ben1009.github.io/mini-lsm). You can use the provided starter
code to kick off your project, and follow the tutorial to implement the LSM tree.

## Development

``` rust
cargo x install-tools
cargo x check
cargo x book
```

If you changed public API in the reference solution, you might also need to synchronize it to the starter crate.
To do this, use `cargo x sync`.

## Structure

* mini-lsm: the final solution code
* mini-lsm-starter: the starter code
* mini-lsm-book: the tutorial

We have another repo mini-lsm-solution-checkpoint at [https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm-solution-checkpoint](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm-solution-checkpoint). In this repo, each commit corresponds to a chapter in the tutorial. We will not update the solution checkpoint very often.

## Progress

We are working on a new version of the mini-lsm tutorial that is split into 3 weeks.

* Week 1: Storage Format + Engine Skeleton
* Week 2: Compaction and Persistence
* Week 3: Multi-Version Concurrency Control
* The Extra Week / Rest of Your Life: Optimizations  (unlikely to be available in 2024...)
