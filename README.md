# LSM in a Week

[![CI (main)](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Build a simple key-value storage engine in a week!

## Tutorial

The tutorial is available at [https://skyzh.github.io/mini-lsm](https://skyzh.github.io/mini-lsm). You can use the provided starter
code to kick off your project, and follow the tutorial to implement the LSM tree.

## Development

```
cargo x install-tools
cargo x check
cargo x book
```

If you changed public API in the reference solution, you might also need to synchronize it to the starter crate.
To do this, use `cargo x sync`.

## Progress

We are working on a new version of the mini-lsm tutorial that is split into 3 weeks.

* Week 1: Storage Format + Engine Skeleton
* Week 2: Compaction and Persistence
* Week 3: Multi-Version Concurrency Control
* The Extra Week / Rest of Your Life: Optimizations  (unlikely to be available in 2024...)
