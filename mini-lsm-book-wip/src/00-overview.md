# Overview

## Structure

chapters + snacks, clear goal

implement, think, try by yourself

required tasks, check your understanding questions, bonus tasks

## Testing

exploring and understanding is more important than passing all the test cases

testing basic requirements, not the internal structure or something

## Solution

### Checkpoints

the final version, but many things can be simplified, read the docs

comments / tests / not up-to-date with the starter code

### How to use the solutions
